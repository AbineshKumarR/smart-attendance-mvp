Smart Attendance System :

Smart Attendance System is a MVP(Minimum Viable Product) that is designed mainly to reduce the proxy attendance, track attendance and save lecture time.
It is a QR / sessionID based attendance system with 2 types of users - the faculty and the student.
The faculty creates a time-bounded attendance session with a single click, generating an unique QR code for each class. 
Students can mark attendance by scanning the QR or manually entering the session ID.
It also includes a faculty analytics dashboard where faculty can see attendance percentages and download CSV export. 
Toggling light / dark mode feature is added for interactivity.
